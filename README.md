# File Handling

You play a game of hangman. First you can choose to restore the highscores and the secret words from backup files to initial values or load from old saved highscores and words. You write in a new secret word. You then look at old secret words and highscores. You can choose the secret word you wrote or a word from the file. The new results are also saved to the file for the next time you play. The files with the words and the highscores are then sorted and rewritten to the file.
